# PentaGE - Penta Game Engine

PentaGE is a C# game engine built using OpenGL and GLFW, developed with the primary goal of learning and exploring the complexities of game engine development. The project aims to provide a basic, lightweight game engine and serves as an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in tackling a substantial and challenging project.

## Purpose and Objectives

The main objectives of the Penta Game Engine project are as follows:

1. **Learning Experience:** The project serves as a valuable learning experience in game engine development, allowing me to delve into low-level graphics programming, event handling, and other essential aspects of game development. Additionally, it provides an excellent opportunity to refresh my math skills, which are crucial for tasks like 3D transformations, physics simulations, and more.

2. **Personal Challenge:** Developing a game engine is a significant endeavor that offers a challenging and rewarding experience. The project encourages continuous learning, problem-solving, and improving programming skills.

3. **Fun and Creativity:** Building a game engine from scratch allows for creative freedom and exploration. It is a playground for trying out new ideas, experimenting with different techniques, and creating unique gameplay experiences.

## Project Status

As of now, the Penta Game Engine is still a work in progress and might not be fully functional. The focus is on incremental development, continuously adding features, and refining existing components. Currently the engine features a game loop, window management, a simple shader system (no management) which draws a test screen, an event management system and custom timing events system. There is no world/scene/object system as of yet.

## Dependencies

The Penta Game Engine relies on [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) and [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) for low-level graphics and window handling.
[Serilog](https://serilog.net/) is used for logging. Serilog is a powerful and extensible logging library that allows detailed logging of events, errors, and debugging information. The engine is designed to log relevant events and information to aid in debugging and understanding the engine's behavior during development.

## Features

The engine aims to provide the following features:

- Rendering using OpenGL: Rendering graphics with the power and flexibility of the OpenGL graphics library.
- Event Handling: Implementing a central EventManager for efficient event management and event distribution.
- Window Management: Utilizing GLFW for window creation and management.
- Basic Physics: Implementing rudimentary physics simulations to handle simple interactions within the game.

## Disclaimer

**Note:** PentaGE is a personal project created for educational purposes and fun. It may not be as optimized or feature-rich as other mature game engines. The primary focus is on the learning process and the journey of building a game engine from scratch.

## Contributions

As the project matures and reaches a more stable and feature-complete state, I may consider opening it up for collaboration and accepting contributions. In the meantime, your support and encouragement are valuable, and I will continue to work on enhancing the engine.

If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, feel free to open an issue. However, please understand that contributions and pull requests are not accepted at this time.

Thank you for your understanding, and stay tuned for updates as the project progresses!
